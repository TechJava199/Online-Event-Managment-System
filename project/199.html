<pre>
Take this kiss upon the brow! 

And, in parting from you now, 

Thus much let me avow-

You are not wrong, who deem

That my days have been a dream; 

Yet if hope has flown away

In a night, or in a day, 

In a vision, or in none, 

Is it therefore the less gone? 

All that we see or seem

Is but a dream within a dream. 
</pre>

HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the 
<br>
look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over 
<br>
explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>
