	  <br>
      <h5 class="w3-center">Tradition since 1889</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Since the beginning of recorded IT history, there has been a need for Event Management.  From the first buggy mainframes, through client-server architecture, and into today’s cloud infrastructure, systems and software continue to spew out an insane amount of event information. For decades, IT professional have struggled with how to handle these events. Now, it’s my pleasure to offer you a brief history of event management.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">The process of planning and coordinating the event is usually referred to as event planning and which can include budgeting, scheduling, site selection, acquiring necessary permits, coordinating transportation and parking, arranging for speakers or entertainers, arranging decor, event security, catering, coordinating with third party vendors, and emergency plans. Each event is different in its nature so process of planning & execution of each event differs on basis of type of event.</p>

      <p class="w3-large">The events industry now includes events of all sizes from the Olympics down to business breakfast meetings. Many industries, charitable organizations, and interest groups hold events in order to market themselves, build business relationships, raise money, or celebrate achievement.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Event management might be a tool for strategic marketing and communication, used by companies of every size. Companies can benefit from promotional events as a way to communicate with current and potential customers. For instance, these advertising-focused events can occur as press conferences, promotional events, or product launches.Event managers may also use traditional news media in order to target their audience, hoping to generate media coverage which will reach thousands or millions of people. They can also invite their audience to their events and reach them at the actual event.</p>

      <p class="w3-large">An event venue may be an onsite or offsite location. The event manager is usually not responsible for operations at rented event or entertainment venues, but will monitor all aspects of the event on site. Some of the tasks listed in the introduction may pass to the venue, but usually at a cost.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">The event manager is the person who plans and executes the event, taking responsibility for the creative, technical, and logistical elements. This includes overall event design, brand building, marketing and communication strategy, audio-visual production, script writing, logistics, budgeting, negotiation, and client service.</p>
